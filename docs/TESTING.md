# Testing strategy

Tests are fixture-first and deterministic. Unit tests cover model validation, parsers, URL normalization, confidence rules, error taxonomy, and serializers. Integration tests run complete fixture projects through the library and CLI. Golden tests lock stable report output.

Required fixture categories: funded, unfunded, multiple sources, contradictory metadata, missing repository, malformed lockfile, aliases, workspaces, optional dependencies, rate limits, and network failure. Fixtures must be synthetic or public and must not contain credentials.

Planned commands after Phase 1 tooling exists: `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, and `npm run build`.
